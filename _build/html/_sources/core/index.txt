A collection of common utilities and small frameworks.

LionFire.Utility.dll
--------------------

A large assortment of things I have found useful.  I plan to refactor this into smaller executables.

* Application/Shell framework - facilitates UI/application separation.  (Separate shell implementations for WPF and console apps exist.)
* Serialization
* Logging
* ...

LionFire.Core.Abstractions
--------------------------

This will be a small collection of common abstractions:

* Logging abstraction
* IOC abstraction (TinyIOC)
* EventAggregation abstraction

LionFire.Core

Default implementations for the abstractions in LionFire.Core.Abstractions

LionFire.Typing
