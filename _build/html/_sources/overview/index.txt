Overview
========

Jared Thirsk and LionFire Games are making available various open source software packages.  Software is all C# so far, with some Aurelia-based web apps potentially coming at some point. 

Current Status
--------------

Although I intend to put up several open source projects, not many are up yet.  My priority right now is to ship some (closed-source) software, but if you stumble upon this site and think some of my software may be useful, let me know by email (jared+public at thirsk.ca) and I'll see if I have time to upload these projects.



VOS
===

Vos (Virtual object system) is an ambitious attempt to create a multi-purpose virtual filesystem, except centered around objects.  As with other virtual filesystems, the underlying data store could be files on a disk, hierarchical data provided by some sort of plugin, or virtual in-memory objects (like the linux /sys filesystem.)
