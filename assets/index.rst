==========
Vos Assets
==========

Assets are referenced by type and a name (or path) that is unique to that type.  This provides a conveneint way to access instances of a type by name without worrying about where they are in a Vos tree.  

Assets will be stored in a location configured once by the application, and the location for each type can be configured independently.

This is a child project of Vos.
